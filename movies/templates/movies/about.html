    <p class="lead">
        Sam's Picks is a community-powered app where users can find a movie or TV show to watch based on my and other community member's
        recommendations. Here registered users can vote for their favorite movies and tv shows, and also discuss and make recommendations in the forums.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each user must be registered and logged-in to vote or add a movie or TV show to the voting page. Each user can view the forums without being logged-in.
        However, in order to post or reply, you must be registered and logged in as well. Please be respectful to others in the forums.
